Q1 review of 2025üîéüî¨

I think 2025 is going to be one those years that is not going to be exciting and at the same time it's not boring, judging from how things having processing so far. But I maybe  wrong, after all we got nine more months to go.
This has led me to be mad at myself because I thought that this year I was going to be taking on the world, and go to college but since I have to rewrite the subject I didn't pass I couldn't attend college. 
I feel a twinge of envy upon noticing my peers succeeded at life, I feel left behind and alone. 
I guess this one of the reason why I push myself to the brink of my sanity and physical capacity or at least I try to. But this is not a why to live, constantly chasing other's success. 
Wile I try not compare myself to others, every now and then coveting gets the best of me and I end up juxtaposing their success with mine. 
"Don't compare yourself to who someone else is today but compare yourself to who you were yesterday" what a beauteous precept but life is riddled with ugly realities which makes it hard at times to see how beautiful things can be. 
I have spent an inordinate amount of my life being a prisoner to people's perception of me.
 It's time I break out this perceptual incarceration. 
"A great part of our life slips through our fingers when we do wrong, an even greater part is lost by our doing nothing at all, and the whole of our life passes by as we are doing something other than what we should." - sad realisation, that's why it's crucial we have a very strong "why" because "he who has a strong why can handle almost any how.". 
To my younger self I want to apologize I said at this moment in time we'll be having the adventure of life but I all I am having is a stroll in my back yard, literally. And to my future self never forget why we're doing this-"To understand the universe from the micro to the macro scale with the hope of changing ourselves and the world for the better."
I may not be where I want to be but non sum quails eram, and that's why even when I fall I still look up and say ad astra.

Now with that out of the way let's advance to the review of 2025

----------------------------------------------
Func and limits | 7/8

Python          | 1/1 - Book done
JS chp 3,4,5,6,7| 5/5
books finished- non
number of pages read: => 274

For python (automate the boring stuff with python) the're some chapters I did skip because I am not going to be using them that much or I couldn't connect to an API (like the gmail API) or I was hesitant to download the module because it might be having a virus like the pdf module for python.

***What I have learnt****
-For physics and mathematics when a chapter has 6 or more subchapters it should be set as the only monthly goal for that subject
 Otherwise set two chapters as monthly goals for each subject, This is because when I  started doing I was able to reach my monthly goals.
-For Python and JavaScript it will depend on my familiarity with the material. But it's advisable that I set two chapters as monthly goals for both.
-I must read more if I want to surpass last year's record of 20 books readüò±.

"All life is an experiment" - Ralph Waldo Emmerson
****Experiments performed****
-I created a Facebook page called M's Diary where I share my learning journey, thoughts and projects and experiments. I also created a medium blog page called Connor the autodidact where I go in depth on my learning Journey, thoughts, projects and experiments. I then created a GitHub repo where I share coding my projects.

WHAT I AM HOPING TO GET OUT OF THIS:
-Hone my writing skills.
-Get better at explaining complex topics.
-Hone my pedagogical skill.
-Have a GitHub repo that stuns (whatever that meansü§£)

-In an attempt to be more productive and stay up late I started consuming a lot energy drinks.
In the first three weeks after the 10th of February my productivity had an exorbitant boost, on the fourth week however I started experiencing fatigue and signs of spontaneous aggravation. I started feeling nauseous and I couldn't concentrate very well.

WHAT DID I LEARN FROM THIS:
-excessive consumption of caffeine is not good
-I do fine on 6 hours of sleep, 5 hours of sleep is my limit if don't want to be easily irritated the next morning.
-From now on I will be drinking less caffeine and will indulge only on weekends when burning the midnight oil coding.

-I have a goal of building a Philosophical search engine, Alethiea. One of the things I have to learn is creating a web crawler.
I am now familiar with using requests, BeautifulSoup but I am not au fait with selenium and other web scraping tools in python,
so that's what I will be learning in the up coming months.

Programming projects for Q1:
-Sonata-search - my lyrics and songs  search engine. It still needs a little bit of fine tuning.
-CLI pomodoro - This is one my favourite so farüòÅ.
-Note worthy - A basic note taking python app.
-and several automation scripts.

The reason I don't have a lot of goals set for June is because during this time I will taking my English exams and this is the last month of the second quarter of the year.
On the last week of June I will take week off from studying to relax and meditate on what I have learnt.
I exited to see how this mini year (second quarter of 2025) will unfold, but I more excited to back to doing music after June.
For a self-directed learner I think I have come very far but this is only just the beginning, ad astra‚ú®üå†.
